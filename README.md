# Grapher
Grapher is a simple CLI utility for taking in .csv files and displaying their output via gnuplot.
I still have *many* things left to implement. This project is more of a C++17 playground as opposed to
something usable by human beings

Requires:
  * Gnuplot
  * Boost (gnuplot requires Boost)
