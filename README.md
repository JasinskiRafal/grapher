# Grapher
Grapher is a simple CLI utility for taking in .csv files and displaying their output via gnuplot.
I still have *many* things left to implement. This project is more of a C++17 playground as opposed to
something usable by human beings.

Requires:
  * Gnuplot
  * Boost (gnuplot requires Boost)

Makes use of
  * Gnuplot iostream (https://github.com/dstahlke/gnuplot-iostream)
  * A really useful stackoverflow post (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1120140/how-can-i-read-and-parse-csv-files-in-c?page=1&tab=votes#tab-top)
